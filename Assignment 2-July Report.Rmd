# Energy Exchange Istanbul (EXIST)
## 1. Introduction

Energy Exchange Istanbul (EXIST) was established on March 12, 2015 upon the Electricity Market Law and  Turkish Trade Law. Main objective and principal business activity is to plan, establish, develop, and manage energy market in a transparent manner that fulfills the requirements of energy market. Energy market in Turkey changes hourly and the related data can be found in the official webpage of EXIST. You can [click](https://rapor.epias.com.tr/rapor/xhtml/ptfSmfListeleme.xhtml), and filter the date you wish to check hourly data. This report has been prepared to examine the month of July 2020 using EXIST data for the electricity market.

The basic approach in electricity energy markets is to ensure that electricity production and electricity consumption are equal. There is a balance that should be struck for this. To preserve this balance, energy markets are conducted and these can be summarized in three groups:<br>
  **1.Day Ahead Market (DAM):** It is the market created according to the next day's hourly electricity plan. Transactions are made on the *Market Clearing Price(MCP)*. 
  The second column in the data we use while creating the report gives hourly MCP information. <br> 
  **2.Intraday Market (IDM):** It is the market that continues throughout the day similar to stock exchange. The reason for the creation of this market is that in most     cases, the forecast due to previous day's plan does not fully comply with the actual demand.Transactions are made on the *Weighted Average Price(WAP)*.<br>
  **3.Balancing Power Market (BPM):** It is the market that is formed due to the electricity energy trade made at the last moment to ensure the balance.Transactions are    made on the *System Marginal Price(SMP)*. The third column in the data we use while creating the report gives hourly SMP information. <br> 

Before we get into the details of the report, there are a few more terms we should be familiar to. These are **energy deficit** and **energy surplus**. In cases where the actual demand is higher than the predicted demand, energy deficit arises, otherwise energy surplus occurs. System Marginal Price(SMP) is always higher than Market Clearing Price(MCP) if system has Energy Deficit, and lower if there is Energy Surplus. Market operator also penalizes the operations in BPM by 3%. This is called **Imbalance Price**. Negative (Deficit) Imbalance Price is calculated as max(MCP,SMP)1.03 ,and Positive Imbalance Price is calculated as min(MCP,SMP)0.97.

## 2. July, 2020 Report 

After downloading the data between 1 July 2020 and 31 July 2020 from the official webpage of EXIST, the analyses can be started. Firstly, a few edits on this data are done in order to have a better comprehension. The basic packages *tidyverse* and *lubridate* are used throughout the report. In addition to these, the *reshape2* package was also useful for the plots. 

```{r 1, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(lubridate)
library(reshape2)
```
```{r 2, message=FALSE}
EXIST_data <- read.csv("ptf-smf.csv")
EXIST_raw_df <- EXIST_data%>%transmute(Date = gsub(pattern = "\\.","-",Date),
            MCP,
            SMP,
            PositiveIP = Positive.Imbalance.Price..TL.MWh.,
            NegativeIP = Negative.Imbalance.Price..TL.MWh.,
            SMPDirection = SMP.Direction)

EXIST_raw_df$Date<-as.POSIXct(EXIST_raw_df$Date,format="%d-%m-%y %H:%M")
head(EXIST_raw_df)
tail(EXIST_raw_df)
```
We can also use the `glimpse` function to inspect our data. By using it,each column is represented in a row with its data type and first few entries. We have 744 rows and 6 variables namely Date, MCP, SMP, Positive Imbalance Price, Negative Imbalance Price, and SMP Direction. 

```{r 3, message=FALSE}
EXIST_raw_df%>%glimpse()
```
In order to limit the number of displayed rows, the following global option can be used.

```{r 4, results="hide"}
options(tibble.print_max = 5, tibble.print_min = 5)
```

Before making a more detailed analysis, it would be useful to give the average prices for the full month of July.The average MCP value is **`r round(mean(EXIST_raw_df$MCP))`** and the average SMP value is **`r round(mean(EXIST_raw_df$SMP))`** in July, 2020. These values can be obtained by using commands below:

```{r 5, results="hide"}
round(mean(EXIST_raw_df$MCP))
round(mean(EXIST_raw_df$SMP))
```

We can check scatter plot in order to see which interval of prices occured more frequently during July, 2020. The plot below shows that for most of the days, MCP lies between 300-330 and SMP lies between 150-350. 

```{r 6, message=FALSE}
ggplot(EXIST_raw_df, aes(x=MCP, y=SMP, color=Date)) + geom_point() +  labs(x="MCP", y="SMP",  title="MCP and SMP Prices",subtitle=" Energy Exchange Turkey(EXIST), between July 01 and July 31")+theme_test()+geom_abline(slope=1, intercept=0, color="red")
```


The bar chart showing the daily change of System Marginal Price and Market Clearing Price values is given below.

```{r 7, message=FALSE}
plot1<-EXIST_raw_df %>% group_by(Day=lubridate::day(Date))%>% summarise(daily_average_MCP = mean(MCP), daily_average_SMP = mean(SMP)) %>% 
      ungroup()%>%select(Day, daily_average_MCP, daily_average_SMP)
plot2<-melt(plot1, id.vars='Day')
plot2%>%ggplot(.,aes(x=Day,y=value, fill=variable)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge")+theme_test()+
      labs(x="Day", y="TL/MWh", 
           title="Daily MCP and SMP Change",
           subtitle=" Energy Exchange Turkey(EXIST), between July 01 and July 31")
```

We may be also interested in the daily difference between these prices. 

```{r 8, message=FALSE}
plot3<-EXIST_raw_df %>% group_by(Day=lubridate::day(Date))%>% summarise(daily_average_MCP = mean(MCP), daily_average_SMP = mean(SMP),Difference = abs(mean(MCP)-mean(SMP)))%>%print(plot3)
plot3%>%ggplot(aes(x=Day)) + geom_line(aes(y = Difference, color = "Difference of average values")) +
     labs(x = "Day", y = "TL/MWh",
          title = "Difference between Daily Average MCP and SMP Change",
          subtitle = " Energy Exchange Turkey(EXIST), between July 01 and July 31")+theme_test()
```

```{r 9, message=FALSE}
plot4<-EXIST_raw_df%>% group_by(Hour=lubridate::hour(Date))%>%summarise(hourly_average_MCP=mean(MCP), hourly_min_MCP=min(MCP), hourly_max_MCP=max(MCP))%>%print()

      labs(x="Hour", y="MCP (TL/MWh)", 
           title=  "Average, Minimum and Maximum Hourly Market Clearing Price(MCP)",

#### 2.1.5. Periodic Day Ahead Market

```{r 13, message=FALSE}
plot8<-EXIST_raw_df %>% 
transmute(MCP,SMP,Hour = as.numeric(lubridate::hour(Date)),Period=ifelse(8<=Hour & Hour<=16,"Day Period",ifelse(17<=Hour & Hour<=22,"Peak Period","Night Period")))%>%  group_by(Period)%>% summarise(Period_average_MCP=mean(MCP))%>% print()
plot8%>% ggplot(.,aes(x=Period,y=Period_average_MCP, fill=Period)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")+theme_test()+
    labs(x="Periods", y="MCP (TL/MWh)",

knitr::kable(Difference, format="markdown")

```


### 2.4. Energy Imbalance

These are **energy deficit**, **energy surplus**, and **energy balance** due to the relationship between actual demand and predicted demand. In the data we examine, there are energy deficit, surplus and balance states on an hourly basis. This information is given in the column called SMP Direction. As we did  with the market prices, we can also make an analysis for these states in order to consider how many deficit, surplus, or balance occured.This may be an important insight regarding the prediction reliability.Before making a more detailed analysis, it would be useful to give the overall state of the mont July of 2020.

```{r 24, message=FALSE}
